# Stability
This is not yet stable or finalized software

Please report any bugs or security issues

## Security
Use at your own risk, if someone can ping your IP they can watch the stream. The apikey feature is not a replacement, it only adds a layer of [obfustication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity#Criticism).
